Here I publicly share my backend development exercises.

## Task 1 — HTTP Authentication

This application should allow users to:
- register
- log in
- log out
- list information about their account

## Task 2 — Static web pages presenting fonts to end user

No backend application makes sense without any kind of front end.
To train my front end skills, I should develop an application
which allows users to:
- preview various fonts pre-installed in application
- select any font to take a close look
- type any text to see how font looks like
- see normal, bold, italic and italic-bold versions of font
- choose font size and color
